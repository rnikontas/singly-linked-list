# singly-linked-list
Singly-linked List implementation in C for Vilnius University Procedural Programming class.

This is a basic singly-linked list implementation using pointers.
The implementation has almost every function (insertion, deletion, data & node search) but lacks some advanced features i.e locating all nodes with specific (same value across several nodes) data, or returning just a single one that is not the very first one found during lookup. As such, this is intended for learning purposes and/or demonstration purposes and not any serious projects (you're free to modify and use it as you see fit, however).
